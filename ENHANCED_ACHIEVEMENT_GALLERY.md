    ...achievement,                    // Original achievement data
    unlocked: boolean,                 // Unlock status

    unlockTimestamp: number,           // When unlocked
    difficulty: 1-5,                   // Calculated difficulty
    searchableText: string,            // Lowercased searchable content
    isNearCompletion: boolean,         // 70%+ progress flag
    progressStatus: string             // 'completed'|'in-progress'|'locked'
